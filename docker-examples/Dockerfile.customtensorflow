#
# This example Dockerfile illustrates a method to apply
# patches to the source code in NVIDIA's TensorFlow
# container image and to rebuild TensorFlow.  The RUN command
# included below will rebuild TensorFlow in the same way as
# it was built in the original image.
#
# By applying customizations through a Dockerfile and
# `docker build` in this manner rather than modifying the
# container interactively, it will be straightforward to
# apply the same changes to later versions of the TensorFlow
# container image.

FROM nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:19.01

# Bring in changes from outside container to /tmp
# (assumes my-tensorflow-modifications.patch is in same directory as Dockerfile)
COPY my-tensorflow-modifications.patch /tmp

# Change working directory to TensorFlow source path
WORKDIR /opt/tensorflow

# Apply modifications
RUN patch -p1 < /tmp/my-tensorflow-modifications.patch

# Rebuild TensorFlow for python 2 and 3
RUN ./nvbuild.sh --python2
RUN ./nvbuild.sh --python3

# Reset default working directory
WORKDIR /workspace
